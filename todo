add option to render full original heads of rules in kbdbg images
#subclass n3 parser(?) and tweak list syntax parsing to produce better names and order
try to make RDR work, if this fails, at least try to change kbdbg to query with standard sparql

use persistent redis file, key by full run identification
emit bnode text as precomputed_text, move the computing function to common
