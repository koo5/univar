#<koo7> so, ones and twos are inputs and threes are outputs?
#<stoopkid> yep, the object of :nand1 or :nand2 is the truth value of input1 or input2, respectively, which will be referenced by the subject, and the object of :nand3 is the truth-value of the output which is represented by the subject
#<stoopkid> from a normal programmer's perspective, it's a really really crude way of handling it
#<stoopkid> :nand1, :nand2, :nand3 all mean the same thing, they only differ in where their subject is being used in the gates



#nand1			truth value o for node s acting as input1 for a gate
#nand2			truth value o for node s acting as input2 for a gate
#nand3			truth value o for node s acting as output for a gate
#gnand1			s is a gate, o is input1
#gnand2			s is a gate, o is input2
#gnand3			s is a gate, o is output
#nandnand1		s/o are gates, and the output of s is input1 for o 
#nandnand2		s/o are gates, and the output of s is input2 for o


#definition of a nand gate
#?A: input1
#?B: input2
#?C: output
#?G: gate
#?C :nand3 "true" basically means that there is *some* gate which returns true with ?C as the output
#wrt this rule, that is
{?G :gnand1 ?A.  ?G :gnand2 ?B.  ?G :gnand3 ?C.  ?A :nand1 "false".  ?B :nand2 "false".} => {?C :nand3 "true"}.
{?G :gnand1 ?A.  ?G :gnand2 ?B.  ?G :gnand3 ?C.  ?A :nand1 "false".  ?B :nand2 "true".} => {?C :nand3 "true"}.
{?G :gnand1 ?A.  ?G :gnand2 ?B.  ?G :gnand3 ?C.  ?A :nand1 "true".  ?B :nand2 "false".} => {?C :nand3 "true"}.
{?G :gnand1 ?A.  ?G :gnand2 ?B.  ?G :gnand3 ?C.  ?A :nand1 "true".  ?B :nand2 "true".} => {?C :nand3 "false"}.

#definition of the connection between gates

#if gate1 is input2 for gate2, 
#and ?x is the output of gate1 
#and ?x is input2 for gate2, 
#and ?v is the truth value of the output of whatever gate ?x is the output of

#then give ?x a :nand2 value of ?v, because it needs to act as input2 for gate2 and the
#truth value for things being used as input2 is stored as the object of :nand2.

#remember how i said it was really crude from a programmer's perspective?
#this translates the output value of a previous gate into something usable for input to another gate
#:nand3 -> :nand1/2
{?G1 :nandnand2 ?G2.  ?G1 :gnand3 ?X.  ?G2 :gnand2 ?X.  ?X :nand3 ?V.} => {?X :nand2 ?V}.
{?G1 :nandnand1 ?G2.  ?G1 :gnand3 ?X.  ?G2 :gnand1 ?X.  ?X :nand3 ?V.} => {?X :nand1 ?V}.

#The facts of the example:

#
#it's a full adder cause it has the carry from the previous bits
#A + B, Cin = (S,Cout)
#0 + 0, n   = (0,n)
#0 + 0, y   = (1,n)
#1 + 0, n   = (1,n)
#1 + 0, y   = (0,y)
#0 + 1, n   = (1,n)
#0 + 1, y   = (0,y)
#1 + 1, n   = (0,y)
#1 + 1, y   = (1,y)


#if it's used as input1, it'll have :nand1 and it'll be it's truth value
#likewise with input2 and :nand2

#this seems rather contrived, like it would be better to just have boolean values and check their value
#but if you look at the diagram from the link you'll see that 
#:a is only used as input1 in any of the gates, so it gets :nand1
#:b is only used as input2 in any of the gates, :nand2
#:Cin is only used as input2 in any of the gates, :nand2


#current bit from first number
:a :nand1 "true" .
#so this should be read as input a on nand1 is true? im guessing so but i haven't determined for sure
#maybe we should just rewrite an adder circuit our own way
#well we could, but..ok if you wish..but im not sure it will help anything
#just press esc twice, btw ah thanks; yea got so focused in the adder logic i forgot about the bug-tracking for a second :)heh
#can you exit, my f keys dont work

#current bit from second number
:b :nand2 "true" .

#carry bit from addition addition of the previous bits 
:cin :nand2 "true" .



#gates 7 and 8 were switched in name but the logic was the same; i switched it to match the diagram tho, for clarity.
